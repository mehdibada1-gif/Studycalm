About this Application
StudyCalm is a mobile application designed to help students manage academic stress and improve mental well-being. Unlike generic planners or wellness apps, StudyCalm is a comprehensive tool that directly links academic tasks with mental health strategies. It provides students with a proactive way to handle pressure before it leads to burnout or anxiety.

The app's core feature is a "stress-aware" study planner that helps students organize their academic work while incorporating essential self-care breaks and exercises. The platform offers a toolkit of scientifically backed features, including guided breathing exercises, focus-enhancing music, and a mood journal. This combination of productivity and well-being tools creates a holistic approach to academic life.

By integrating study management with mental health support, StudyCalm empowers students aged 13â€“22 to build emotional resilience and a healthier relationship with their education. It serves as both a study companion and a personal well-being coach, providing a much-needed, age-appropriate solution to the rising mental health challenges in academic environments.
