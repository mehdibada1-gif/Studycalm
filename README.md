##  Vercel Deployment

To deploy this application to Vercel, follow these steps:

1. **Push to GitHub:** Ensure your latest code is pushed to a GitHub repository.

2. **Import Project in Vercel:**
   - Log in to your Vercel account.
   - Click on "Add New..." -> "Project".
   - Import the GitHub repository you just created.

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - In the project settings on Vercel, navigate to the "Environment Variables" section.
   - You will need to add the Firebase configuration details. Your `src/lib/firebase.ts` file contains these values, but they should be stored securely as environment variables for production.
   - Add the following variables:

   | Name | Value |
   | :--- | :--- |
   | `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY` | Your Firebase `apiKey` |
   | `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` | Your Firebase `authDomain` |
   | `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` | Your Firebase `projectId` |
   | `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`| Your Firebase `storageBucket` |
   | `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`| Your Firebase `messagingSenderId` |
   | `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID` | Your Firebase `appId` |
   | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Your Google AI (Gemini) API Key |

   **Important:** You will also need to update `src/lib/firebase.ts` to *use* these environment variables instead of hardcoding the values. This is critical for security.

4. **Deploy:** Once the variables are set, trigger a deployment. Vercel will build and deploy your application.

## Firebase Setup

This application requires a Firebase project with **Firestore Database** and **Authentication** enabled.

### Security Rules

You must configure Firestore security rules to protect user data. Go to the "Rules" tab in your Firestore database and paste the following:

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /journalEntries/{entryId} {
      allow create, read, update, delete: if request.auth != null && request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }
  }
}
```

### Firestore Indexes

The application's queries require a composite index. In your Firestore "Indexes" tab, create a new index with the following configuration:

- **Collection ID:** `journalEntries`
- **Fields to index:**
  1. `userId` (Ascending)
  2. `date` (Descending)
- **Query scope:** `Collection`
