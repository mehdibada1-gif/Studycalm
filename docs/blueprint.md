## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#D1B0FF) to promote calmness and relaxation. This evokes the essence of tranquility and mindful study.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) to provide a neutral, clean backdrop, and reduce screen glare. This understated hue ensures a soothing and distraction-free visual experience.
- Accent color: Pale blue (#A0D2EB) used for interactive elements. Positioned analogously on the color wheel, the blue enhances visual appeal.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) to make the app both modern and a bit more warm or personalized than the usual font.
- Use clean, minimalist icons that represent calmness, focus, and study. All icons should have a similar stroke and level of detail, with rounded corners.
- Maintain a clean, uncluttered layout with ample white space to avoid overwhelming users.
- Incorporate subtle animations for transitions and interactions. They should be smooth and calming.
